# Motivation
While brainstorming ideas, our group agreed that we wanted to work on something that would make our lives more organized. We talked about how stressed and rushed we were in the mornings, so we wanted to focus on something to streamline that process. Each member of the group gave input on things that they like to know when they get up, and we started prioritizing which features were feasible with our limited time and skills.

# Project Title: Good Morning, Sunshine!
Good Morning, Sunshine is a web page that brings all of that information to one place with simple cards: news, local weather, relevant personal notes, and daily horoscope. For more information, each card is linked to more in-depth material: the top headlines, weather forecast for the week, detailed notes, and horoscopes for all astrological signs.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
